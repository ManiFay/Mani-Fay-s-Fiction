                    Hi, I'm Mani Fay, an author of fantasy, romance, poetry, and the occasional thriller. Here at Mani Fay's
                    Fiction, I hope to enrich your mind with the content I create! Although, you may want to get to know me first.
                    For starters, I am an avid reader of romance, fantasy, and historical fiction. I have hobbies of journaling and
                    writing (obviously) along with drawing since I was in third grade. I have with other interests such as photography,
                    ukulele, and japanese. My first language is American English, but I refuse to spell grey like "gray." It just doesn't
                    feel right to me... I am learning spanish as of now and can have a very simple conversation with other spanish speakers.
                    I code and made this website myself. Just like my Spanish, it is a beginner skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, I am a cat person. Just look at this little guy!

                <p>
                    With all those details said and done, I bet you want to know what I can do for you as a reader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, I can bring your dream worlds into fruition, write a poem for your or your partner, write an article for you, and so
                    much more! All good things must come at prices and conditions, and you can see for yourself what I can do and at what cost.
